# stock-price-prediction-using-LSTM
Stock Price Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) In this project daily closing price of a stock has been predicted using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). More specifically, an LSTM model has been built which will predict the daily closing price of Grameenphone (GP), a telecom operator enlisted in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), based on its historical stock data. For the time being, the model has been trained on the historical data of 2019 and prediction has been made on the data of 2020 (Data Source: https://www.dsebd.org/). The data of January 2020 and the data of February 2020 have been used as validation set  and test set respectively. To conduct the project several python libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib have been used.
